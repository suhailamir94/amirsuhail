          I am a seasoned software expert who has worked for companies such as
          Arista Networks, Accenture and IBM, as well as many venture-backed
          businesses. I specialize in building applications specific to the
          business needs of my clients. I have done work in software
          development, mobile app creation, front-end/back-end web and
          database/server management
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to
          detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven
          work ethic to literally change the world. That's why Iâ€™m excited to
          make a big impact at a high growth company.
